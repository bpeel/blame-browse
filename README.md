# Blame browse

Blame browse is a small utility to browse the output of git-blame. You can open a source file and see which commits last touched each line. The main useful feature over just running git-blame on the terminal is that if you click on a commit hash you have a button to jump to the parent of that commit and browse the same file with that commit. This is really useful when the line you are interested in has been modified by more than one commit and you want to look back in the history.
